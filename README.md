# n8n - Serverless, Container Apps

This repository contains resources to deploy n8n in Azure Container Apps.

Azure Container Apps consumption plan can be very cost-effective, as it is billed based on per-second resource allocation and requests. The first 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds, and 2 million requests each month are free.

On the other hand, it can scale to many instances to handle high traffic and operate more efficiently than n8n on App Service.
